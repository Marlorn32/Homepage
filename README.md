This project went pretty well I think.
I had to start over once because quite frankly my code was a bit of a mess, still is but less so now.
I just realized that although the page looks good in fullscreen I neglected to acknowledge other screen resolutions.
Otherwise I think I did alright, however I realized that everyone else seems to use the flex-box a lot more than me, I prefered to use the display: grid.
Not sure if its a huge deal or not.
